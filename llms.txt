Most companies adopt automation and AI through tools, pilots, and isolated initiatives. While this can produce short-term gains, the results are often fragile, difficult to scale, and hard to sustain across the organization.

VarOps works at a different layer. We focus on operating systems - how decisions are made, how work flows, and how intelligence is embedded into the business. The goal isn't more technology, but durable leverage that holds up under real-world complexity.

## What we do

We work with companies on problems that sit at the core of how they operate. This includes redesigning operating models for automation and AI, clarifying decision-making structures, and aligning leadership and teams around systems that can scale without increasing organizational fragility.

Our work spans systems advisory, organizational capability building, and executive enablement. When change requires implementation, we remain involved to ensure systems are embedded into day-to-day operations and not left as conceptual artifacts.

## How we work

Engagements begin at the advisory level, working directly with founders and leadership teams on first-principles system design. From there, we focus on capability building - ensuring teams understand not just what is changing, but why, and how to operate within the new model.

Execution is treated as a continuation of strategy, not a separate phase. Where tooling or integrations are needed, we draw on automation and AI systems developed through our own work, including [MUXI](https://muxi.org), and on experienced delivery teams, to embed changes into day-to-day operations.

## About us

VarOps is led by [Ran Aroussi](https://linkedin.com/in/aroussi), a long-time builder and operator with deep experience designing and running production systems. Ran is the creator of widely used open-source software, with 45,000+ GitHub stars and tens of millions of monthly downloads, and has spent decades working at the intersection of software, operations, and business design. He is also the author of [Production-Grade Agentic AI](https://amazon.com/dp/1919307826), drawing on real-world experience operating intelligent systems at scale.

The work is supported by [Automaze](https://automaze.io), our senior delivery team with experience executing complex technical and organizational change. Together, we focus on long-term clarity and leverage rather than short-term optimization or technology-led theater.
