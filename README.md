# Groovy Made  
### A corporate umbrella for independent builders.

Groovy Made helps founders turn good ideas into real revenue. We take care of contracts, payments, admin, and taxes – so you can stay focused on building and getting paid, instead of on corporate drama.

## 👋 Hey – thanks for dropping by

If you’ve ever built a product, you know the feeling:

You’ve got the idea, the code, the IP – but then come the contracts, taxes, payments, refunds, and admin spread across three countries.  
The stuff nobody talks about when you’re dreaming up your next big thing.

We’ve lived that too.

So we built **Groovy Made** – the back office for smart founders.

We handle everything behind the scenes so you can focus on what you do best: building and shipping.

No equity drama.  
No corporate clutter.  
No messy spreadsheets.  

Just clean, fair royalty payouts – and optional help with the extras when you need it.

## 💼 What we do

- Draft clear, royalty-based partnership agreements  
- Register your project under our corporate umbrella  
- Optionally act as Merchant of Record for digital sales  
- Handle payments, refunds, taxes, and compliance  
- Maintain separate P&L tracking for each project  
- Pay creators quarterly – up to 80% of net receipts  
- Offer optional add-ons like launch help, branding, or light advisory  

---

## 🎯 Who it’s for

- Indie founders, solo builders, and tiny teams  
- One-person plugins, AI experiments, small SaaS products  
- Anyone who wants to launch and get paid – without the overhead

## ⚙️ How it works

1. **Bring your idea** – if it’s real IP, we’ll help you wrap it properly  
2. **We run the back office** – contracts, billing, admin, and taxes  
3. **You get paid** – quarterly royalties with clear statements and clean separation between projects  

Every project operates as its own royalty-bearing entity.  
We manage the boring stuff – you keep control of your product and profits.

## 🔍 Why royalties?

Sometimes you don’t need cofounders.  
Sometimes you don’t want to split your equity pie.  
Sometimes you just want a clean way to launch, share revenue, and stay independent.  

**Royalties keep it simple.**  
No dilution. No legal tangles. Just fair splits for real work.

## 🌍 Behind the scenes

Groovy Made Ltd is a Hong Kong–registered company that provides compliant global operations for indie founders, digital creators, and micro-teams.

Some projects eventually grow into standalone companies – and that’s exactly the point.
