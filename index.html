        <h1>Systems-level advisory and capability building for companies adopting automation and AI at scale.</h1>

        <p class="lead-text">
            Working directly with founders and leadership teams to redesign operating systems, align organisations
            around them, and embed intelligence where decisions actually happen.
        </p>

        <a target="calcom" href="https://cal.com/varopsco/30min" class="btn">Let’s talk ›</a>

        <p>
            Most companies adopt automation and AI through tools, pilots, and isolated initiatives. While this can
            produce short-term gains, the results are often fragile, difficult to scale, and hard to sustain across the
            organisation.
        </p>
        <p>
            VarOps works at a different layer. We focus on operating systems - how decisions are made, how work flows,
            and how intelligence is embedded into the business. The goal isn’t more technology, but durable leverage
            that holds up under real-world complexity.
        </p>

        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <p>
            We work with companies on problems that sit at the core of how they operate. This includes redesigning
            operating models for automation and AI, clarifying decision-making structures, and aligning leadership and
            teams around systems that can scale without increasing organisational fragility.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our work spans systems advisory, organisational capability building, and executive enablement. When change
            requires implementation, we remain involved to ensure systems are embedded into day-to-day operations and
            not left as conceptual artefacts.
        </p>

        <h2>How we work</h2>
        <p>
            Engagements begin at the advisory level, working directly with founders and leadership teams on
            first-principles system design. From there, we focus on capability building - ensuring teams understand not
            just what is changing, but why, and how to operate within the new model.
        </p>
        <p>
            Execution is treated as a continuation of strategy, not a separate phase. Where tooling or integrations are
            needed, we draw on automation and AI systems developed through our own work, including <a
                href="https://muxi.org">MUXI</a>, and on experienced delivery teams, to embed changes into day-to-day
            operations.
        </p>

        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>
            VarOps is led by <a target="_blank" href="https://linkedin.com/in/aroussi">Ran Aroussi</a>, a long-time builder and operator
            with deep experience designing and running production systems.
            Ran is the creator of widely used open-source software, with tens of millions of monthly downloads, and has
            spent decades working at the intersection of software, operations, and business design.
            He is also the author of <a target="_blank" href="https://amazon.com/dp/1919307826">Production-Grade Agentic AI</a>, drawing
            on real-world experience operating intelligent systems at scale.
        </p>
        <p>
            The work is supported by a senior delivery team with experience executing complex technical and
            organisational change. Together, we focus on long-term clarity and leverage rather than short-term
            optimisation or technology-led theatre.
        </p>
